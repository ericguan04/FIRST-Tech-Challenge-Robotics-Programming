# FIRST-Tech-Challenge-Robotics-Programming
Documentation of my contributions to the Queens Metropolitan High School FIRST Robotics Team (#14212). The purpose of this repository is for both members of the team and I to reference and learn/relearn.

2020-2021: Programming Team Member (Blocks Programming)

2021-2022: Programming Leader (Java with Android Studio)

2022-2023: Alumni Team Mentor (Java with Android Studio)

# Programming Engineering Notebook

Notebook that documents all the planning, writing, testing, and debugging of the code used throughout my season.

* Includes documentation of Blocks and Java (Android Studio IDE) programming

# Notable Robotics Programming Algorithms / Concepts Used

Finite State Machine (FNS)
* Code found in Official Tele-Op and Finite State Machine Testing documents
* Utilized enumerator (enum) data type and switch-case to store constants that would be used as "states" for the robot to shift between
* For FTC Robotics, FNS can be used to allow automation of systems while retaining control over the movement of the robot

OpenCV (for computer vision/object detection)
* Code found in Autonomous Testing document
* Implemented OpenCV library into software for real time computer vision
* Robot autonomously chooses a path to take depending on the color detected and position of object on the screen by the camera on the robot

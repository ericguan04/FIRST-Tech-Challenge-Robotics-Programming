# Programming Engineering Notebook

Notebook that documents all the planning, writing, testing, and debugging of the code used throughout the season.

* Includes documentation of Blocks and Java (Android Studio IDE) programming

# FTC Control Award

Overview of all the key algorithms, sensors (computer vision, color sensor), autonomous, and player-controlled code used during the season

* Won Freight Frenzy Control Award 3rd Place

# Notable Engineering Programming Algorithms / Concepts Used

Finite State Machine (FNS)
* Code found in Official Tele-Op and Finite State Machine Testing documents
* Utilized enumerator (enum) data type and switch-case to store constants that would be used as "states" for the robot to shift between
* For FTC Robotics, FNS can be used to allow automation of systems while retaining control over the movement of the robot

OpenCV (for computer vision/object detection)
* Code found in Autonomous Testing document
* Implemented OpenCV library into software for real time computer vision
* Robot autonomously chooses a path to take depending on the color detected and position of object on the screen by the camera on the robot
